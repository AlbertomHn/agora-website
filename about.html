<p>From the individual level up to the 'new government' level. The individual is respected or not, the invidual can support 'something'
(file, article, proposition, etc) and that support will increase 'public karma'. Like the scientific method, we have peers who criticize it.
When  certain individuals form a group ( by supporting the same 'thing'  ), they can get larger and larger with more and more supporters =>
 thus, greater karma. When the karma exceeds a certain level of 'excitement' (like a software neural network or some complex sociological 
 deductive system of rules ) it will be recognized as a 'Movement'. These movements will be different in many ways ( cant even imagine
 everything yet ) from individuals, but the power of both  should   be relatively the same (it must be possible for some Einstein to be the hero 
 (1 individual => change the world) but also the group counts, the force/wave). Everything must be time-related and supported by an artificial 
 agent ( with human assistence ) to guide the ratings and maybe even 'suggest' possible problems - like a development group inside  - ( conflicting 
 arguments ? popular 'ideas', the biggest 'movement' ( depends on time ) ). Users control their privacy with great care ( well, they can, dont
  know if they will, default settings must be secure ). We can then graph a MOS graphs: Movements of society graphs. These will display the movement,
  direction  its going, change in behavior (whatever that  might be?), change in population/followers ( hence twitter.. ). Those graphs
  ( have to think of some nice features of it .. ) can be used to  graph countries and act like a 'digital constitution'. Which supports of 
  acts as the official constitution of the country. </p>

<p>I was suggesting something like a distributed system where authority ( trust/privacy/etc ) has to be earned and will automatically develop 
things as "movements" and "groups".[1] Have to think moreabout it ( when i finish eating ) but i am thinking about the concept that there is
"information out there in the system". This information has high entropy, noting: its scattered all over the place. Every person has some
expertise, "knows how to deal with a certain problem X". - Differet aproach can be put here by a feature wich can agroup similar  groups
in macro-groups. People will start public groups, private groups, 'movements' ( collection of  groups with different expertise ).- what 
If those groups of peoples  dont need to choose what group they are in, but this groups are  created by a need in the system - like twitter
does with TTs, but, the  group itself choose what people are in , by  refering  to information  that this groups share and acess in they
clients.Now, there must be  some kind of "topics" or "pieces of information" - cloud tag/text? -  that can be linked to and be associated
 with 0 or more groups. This  way, information is unrated ( which is must be i think ) and groups  will 'collect' information from 'the
information space' ( just writing some text,uploading a photo or evidence ). This collection of  information  has  to be rated based on 
some authority ( difficult point, because the democracy as a whole should have no authority differences between individuals, but you
want to have some control over the  quality of information. Just like I was talking about the scientific method integration into the system.
Information from the proces like-scientific-method will be seen as 'ok' or 'more ok', also depends on some complex factors. 
In democracy nowadays,everyone can vote, even  when they have no knowledge on the subject, which is a shame ( if you use your vote to count
even if you have no clue what your  voting  for ). Currently,in most democratic systems the voters can vote on certain 'parties' 
( which i would call a 'movement', but  movements do have different tasks and properties, but for now the  comparison is  clear  ).
So, voting on movements ( people can subtract their vote! we  must acknowledge that the world changes! you cannot  hold the same
perspective of the world for decades ( well if you do, then you are not the type of person who should vote for the future 
because it only depends on your history.. ). Anyway, the problem with (2 or more) parties is that you must vote on a list of general
'important' topics and vote for the one or the other. Most of the time it is like this: "hmm, i like the way political party #1 handles traffic but I also like the way party #2 is handling health care". So, given that problem,we must solve that with a system where you can vote on 'topics' ( also has complex  factors to think about before we 'do' ).</p>

<header><h1>Statements</h1></header>
Just a list of point which i will convert into seamless text:<br><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> uses scientific references and critical thinking to create a suggestion of 'truth'</li>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> has a constitution ( kind of 'big bang' or 'axioms' )</li>

<li><strong>Agora</strong> resembes the process of the scientific method to come to a self-improving process towards truth</li>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> lets movements with different worldviews compete eachother by critical thinking and rational behavior </li>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> has a central panel which contains chosen individuals who have a different karma then most. Everyone can join the panel by being publicly chosen</li>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> enables the public to chose the critical thinkers and replace them, if neccessary</li>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> shows the most complete worldview written by the people for the people on which we all can rely to provide the best quality of life as possible</li>

<li><strong>Agora</strong> will be represented as a political party in many countries to help with the transition to a better society</li>
<li><strong>Agora</strong> enables movements to involve in political activism, both online and offline ( demonstrations, ddos, information freedom, etc )</li>
